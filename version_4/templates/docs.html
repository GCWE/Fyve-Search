                    Fyve Search is a metasearch engine - that is, it collates the search results from
                    multiple different search engines (e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo) and outputs them to
                    you, the user.
                    <br><br>
                    It works through the process of web scraping (BeautifulSoup4), which involves a HTML
                    parser that effectively conducts a "search" on the many different search engines for
                    unique links.
                    <br><br>
                    This then all gets wrapped up in a Docker container, for added security (see below).

                <p>
                    <br>
                    
                    There are a few reasons why you might want to use Fyve Search as opposed to one of
                    your standard search engines.

                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Search Efficiency:</b> Did you know that search engines like Google only index about 5% of the entirety of the internet?
                        By utilizing numerous different search engines in outputting search results,
                        Fyve Search therefore ensures that you don't miss out on that one search link
                        you need, and thereby saves you heaps of time from aimlessly scouring through
                        pages of search results (you know what I mean!).
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Privacy:</b> In our modern age, and with more and more of our personal information
                        getting stored online, it has become more important than ever that there are
                        means for us to stay safe online. And yet it seems that the search engines of
                        today not only fail to properly protect users from online hackers, but <i>contribute</i>
                        to the issue through selling user information to thirdy-party services!
                        <br>
                        With Fyve Search, you don't have to worry about these issues - through means of Docker
                        containers that separate the metasearch engine (as well as a dedicated browser) from your
                        local machine, you can rest assured that any hacker who taps into your system will be kept
                        isolated within the Docker container, and have no access to your personal files/folders.
                        What's more, as soon as you close your browser session the Docker container self-destructs,
                        thereby disconnecting the hacker entirely from your device.
                        <br>
                        The integration of a Tor proxy also aims to shield your IP address/location by tunneling
                        it through a series of proxy servers (and constantly changing the IP address) and thereby
                        preventing those pesky third-party organizations from building a database of information
                        about you.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Royalty-Free Images:</b> All "image engines" used in Fyve Search provide completely
                        free-to-use images/graphics. Never again will you have to worry about violating copyright
                        issues when using online photos for commercial purposes.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>AI Search Results:</b> Fyve Search allows you to connect Fyve search to a Groq API key,
                        which in turn grants you access to 
                        <br>
                        As of the time of writing these Docs, Groq AI is completely free to use. ðŸ¥³
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Maximum Customization:</b> I believe that you can only be most efficient when you
                        work in an environment tailor-made for you. That is precisely what Fyve Search offers:
                        be it colour schemes, or search engine selection, you're in full control.

                    <b>Why am I receiving errors when running Fyve Search?</b>
                    <br><br>
                    One possibility is that Docker may not have been properly installed - if you're sure it has been, check to see if the Docker Engine is running properly.
                    
                    <br><br><br>
                    
                    <b>How do I enable AI Search (Groq)?</b>
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    You can enable AI Search by first setting the "AI Search" toggle on the Settings page.
                    <br><br>
                    To get your Groq API key, head over to the "GroqCloud" site and create an account. Doing
                    so should grant you access to the "API Keys" tab, where you can then generate a connection
                    token. Paste this into the input box in the Fyve Search Settings page, and voila! You're all set.
                    <br><br>
                    Test it out by searching something!
                    
                    <br><br><br>
                    
                    <b>Do I have to use the Dockerized Chromium wrapper?</b>
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Although it is not compulsory to run Fyve Search in the dedicated Chromium wrapper, I very much
                    encourage it - this is because most common browsers also involve some tracking services that
                    sell user data to third-party organizations (for monetization purposes); a problem which the
                    Chromium browser aims to resolve through integration with the Tor proxy.
                    <br><br>
                    However, if you simply want to run Fyve Search in another web browser, there are some additional
                    steps you will need to take to set it up:
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Replace the entire "run_chromium.py" with the following:
                        <br><br>
                        <i>import os</i>
                        <br>
                        <i>os.system("docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d")</i>
                    </li>
                    <br><br>
                    <li>
                        Run the program as normal. Go to your browser and type "0.0.0.0:8080" - the
                        Fyve Search homepage should appear.
                    </li>
                    <br><br>
                </ol>
